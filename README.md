# SPOT-1D-LM
SPOT-1D-LM: Reaching Alignment-profile-based Accuracy in Predicting Protein Secondary and Tertiary Structural Properties without Alignment.

System Requirements
----

**Hardware Requirements:**
SPOT-1D-LM predictor has been tested on standard ubuntu 18 computer with approximately 32 GB RAM to support the in-memory operations.

* [Python3.7](https://docs.python-guide.org/starting/install3/linux/)
* [Anaconda](https://anaconda.org/anaconda/virtualenv)
* [CUDA 10.1](https://developer.nvidia.com/cuda-10.1-download-archive) (Optional if using GPU)
* [cuDNN (>= 7.4.1)](https://developer.nvidia.com/cudnn) (Optional if using GPU)
